            The year is 1918 and the location of the earliest documented case of the spanish flu is taken place in kansas in the united states. The cause of this flu is thought to be from cow manure being burned in the air in Fort Filey. It was certain that young men leaving the fort for military service carried the virus to the battlefields in europe which would then infect hundreds of thousands more people.<p>The Effect The Spanish Flu took on the world was very bad. For example, the life expectancy in the United States had dropped by 12 years and it wasn't just the United States but the life expectancy also dropped for other countries besides the United States Too. The effects the Influenza had on the Soldiers in the battlefield is that it clogged transportation lines, overcrowded hospitals, killed thousands of soldiers, and rendered many soldiers non-effective. The Influenza also exhausted soldiers and made them demoralized. It was also said that the Influenza killed more American Military personnel than factors from the enemy.  </p></div>

            <p>The expansion of military institutions in the united states created a network of young adults acros which the Spanish flu would travel through to infect people. Besides the expansion of military insitutions,  US soldiers being sent to the battlefields in Europe also contributed to the rising toll of people getting infected with this new disease.</p>

            <p>There were no treatments for the Influenza and the Influenza grew very rapidly because people didn't know any way to prevent the disease. There were no vaccines to prevent the disease and technology in the time period couldn't figure out just what the Spanish flu was (it was a virus and the microscopes couldn't see it). The symptoms of this disease would be:</p>
            <P>•Fever </P>
            <p>•Dry Cough</p>
            <p>•Headache and body aches</p>
            <p>•Sore throat</p>
            <p>•Chills</p>
            <p>•Runny nose</p>
            <p>•Loss of appetite</p>
            <p>•Fatigue</p>

            <p> <span class="citation">“Hell is not fire; that would be the ultimate in suffering. Hell is mud.”</span> Conditions in the trenches were severely horrible. Rats and lice tormented Troops which also contributed to diseases spreading in the trenches which included Trench fever which was caused by lice which gave soldiers headaches, fevers, and muscle pain. Then there was the unsanitary conditions of being stationed in trenches which will give you trench foot which if not taken care of will lead to gangrene and amputation of the foot. </p>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">In the trenches  </span><p><span class="headline hl6">How was life in the trenches?</span></p></div><p>Being stationed in the trenches was  very boring and literally the worst. There was always random shelling that could possibly kill you or there was the chance of getting shot by a sniper if you lifted your head a little bit up. The enemy always remained hidden from view and and always had their sights looking for a helmet. These 2 factors contributed to soldiers being extreme stress and exhaustion  </p></div>
